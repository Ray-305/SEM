# Use the HolzingerSwineford1939 dataset to create a new model of textual speed with the variables x4, x5, and x6, which represent reading comprehension and understanding word meaning. x7, x8, and x9 represent speed counting and addition. 

# Load the lavaan library
library(lavaan)

# Look at the dataset
data(HolzingerSwineford1939)
head(HolzingerSwineford1939[ , 7:15])

# Define your model specification
text.model <- 'textspeed =~ x4+x5+x6+x7+x8+x9'

# Building Political Democracy Model

# creating a model with one latent variable, named poldemo60, and four manifest variables- y1-y4.

# Load the lavaan library
library(lavaan)

# Look at the dataset
data(PoliticalDemocracy)
